In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:  ```php $myArray = []; $myArray["value"] = 10; // Explicit key $myArray[10] = 20; // Implicit numeric key echo $myArray[0]; // Outputs nothing, not an error!  echo $myArray[1]; // Outputs nothing, not an error!  print_r($myArray); // Shows only ['value'] => 10 and [10] => 20  ``` Notice that accessing elements using numerical indices that were not explicitly assigned does not result in an error but simply returns nothing. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and make debugging challenging because it does not raise a clear error message.
